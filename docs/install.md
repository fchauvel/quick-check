# Install quick-check

The simplest solution is to a Javascript package manager, such as Yarn
or NPM.

```console
$ cd my-project
$ npm install @fchauvel/quick-check --save
```

Alternatively, you can point directly to the Github repository, should
you want to benefit from the latest commits.

```console
$ cd my-project
$ npm install --save fchauvel/quick-check#dev
```

Note that we point here to the `dev`branch, where most of the
development takes place.
